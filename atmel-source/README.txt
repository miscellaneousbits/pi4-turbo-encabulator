Builing the Atmel Tiny212 image you will need to have installed the
Atmel Studio 7 suite and use it to build the ATTiny212 project.

To program the Atmel you'll need to use a compatible programmer. The
Atmel Tiny line uses the UPDI 3 wire protocol for flash programming
and debug, but there's no need to blow $100 and up on a commercial
programmer. See https://www.jsykora.info/2019/04/avr-updi-programmer-from-attiny817-xplained-mini/
for a $15 programing solution.
